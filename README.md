## Hi there 👋

I'm Vladimir, a software developer with 8+ years of commercial work experience. I am currently working at [Next Lotto](https://www.nextlotto.de/).

I mostly develop mobile apps (native **Android** & **Kotlin Multiplatform**), and I've always been into video games as well (I worked as a [game journalist](https://stopgame.ru/user/Ultra_V1olence/pubs) for a while and even wrote a book about game localisation). I have many passions, and this GitHub is where my side ventures come to life 👨‍💻✨

## My Projects

㊗️ **[Hiragana Teacher](https://github.com/sechkarev/KMPHiraganaTeacher)** – my personal passion project: a mobile app (Android & iOS) that teaches the basics of Japanese in a playful and inspirational manner. Currently in development. Tech stack: **Kotlin, KMP, Swift, Compose Multiplatform, Google ML Kit**.

🎮 **[Stopgate](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376420/StopGate/)** – a comedy PC game I was the main programmer of (the team comprised about 10 people). Tech stack: **Unity, C#, [Fungus](https://github.com/snozbot/fungus)**. 500+ reviews on Steam, 91% positive.

## Smaller Games

🏓 **[Ergodic Pong Review](https://ultra-v1olence.itch.io/ergodic-pong-review)** – my attempt to create an [ergodic literary work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature): it's a text about the videogame Pong, and you have to play Pong while reading it, so the longer you stay in the game the more you learn. Tech stack: **Unity, C#**. Source code available [here](https://github.com/sechkarev/PongReview).

⌚ **[Watch Out! For Cars](https://github.com/sechkarev/tizen-cars)** – my 2016 game for Samsung Gear S2 watches (Tizen OS) where you control a car by rotating the bezel of the watch. Tech stack: **Tizen SDK, HTML, CSS, JavaScript**. Unavailable for download anymore, since Tizen App Store got shut down in 2025 😞
